Angular Stock Chart Example
Stock Changes: Microsoft vs Google 

The Ignite UI for Angular Stock Chart, sometimes referred to as Angular Financial Chart or Candlestick Chart, 
is a composite visualization that renders stock ticker data, or price data in an interactive time-series display. 
Stock Chart shows stock prices for a ticker over time in a Time Series X-Axis. Also, this chart shows information
for a companyâ€™s ticker data like Open Price, High Price, Low Price and Close Price (OHLC) for configurable period of time. 
The Stock Chart offers multiple ways in which the data can be visualized and interpreted, including display modes for
price and volume and a host of Stock indicators.

You can create Stock Chart using the IgxFinancialChartComponent control by binding your data and optionally setting 
chartType property to Line value, as shown in the example below.
