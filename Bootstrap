Build and extend in real-time with CSS variables

Bootstrap 5 is evolving with each release to better utilize CSS variables for global theme styles, individual components, and even utilities. 
We provide dozens of variables for colors, font styles, and more at a :root level for use anywhere. 
On components and utilities, CSS variables are scoped to the relevant class and can easily be modified.


Personalize it with Bootstrap Icons

Bootstrap Icons is an open source SVG icon library featuring over 1,800 glyphs, with more added every release. 
They're designed to work in any project, whether you use Bootstrap itself or not. 
Use them as SVGs or icon fontsâ€”both options give you vector scaling and easy customization via CSS.


Make it yours with official Bootstrap Themes

Take Bootstrap to the next level with premium themes from the official Bootstrap Themes marketplace. 
Themes are built on Bootstrap as their own extended frameworks, rich with new components and plugins, documentation, and powerful build tools.
